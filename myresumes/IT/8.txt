I have many years of experience in the IT environment with around 18 years of experience accumulated in different clients and different working environments, from the banking environment to public administration and telephone services. I have worked both web and stand alone applications as well as middleware (TUXEDO), in both structured and OO projects.  
I also have many years of experience as a company manager and as a company administrator with an average workforce of 15 employees.  
I am a dynamic person and open to new work experiences. My characteristics are: a marked propensity for problem solving, a strong search for results, and attention to details. I have no problem working in a team even if it is made up of people younger than me, and I am available to receive information without objection. I am used to working in an environment under stress without paying attention to working times. I am a friendly person and inclined to human relations.
