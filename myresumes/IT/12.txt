ABOUT ME  
I'm a Fashion Photographer that means my passion is also my work and i could have never desired something better than this.   
  
I graduated from Marangoni Institute in Milan and i've been living here for a year.   
When I firstly came across in photography field I found it so captivating that I cannot help but examine it in depht, let its becoming my daily bread.  
  
I've always thought Fashion and Photography are in osmosis between them, gaining suggestions and knowledges  
with one another. And it is where they meet each other that I chose to go. I want to join these fields together because they are not so distant.  
Furthermore I aspire to address my work to people who cannot be satisfied with conventional shootings made with tradition mood, to people who can be able to appreciate something unequal.
